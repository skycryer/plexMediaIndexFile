Plex Media Index File Backup Script
==========================
This script copies the media index files from the Plex Media Server to the referenced Movie folder for backup.

To restore the index files i wrote a Plex Scanner you can find on my gitHub Channel.

------------
- xampp or other php and mysql webserver
- plex media server
- index-sd.big files must be generated by your plex media server

Installation
------------
- import the sql file into your mysql Database to create the needed table
- add user and db settings in Connections/local.php

Please use it at your own risk, i used it for my whole media without problems.
